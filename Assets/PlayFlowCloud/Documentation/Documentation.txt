**PlayFlow Server URL: Port** - Your game server's URL and Port. Make sure to update your server's port in your server configuration (i.e Network Manager or Transport) with the PlayFlow port

**Arguments (optional)** - Any arguments you'd like to provide to start your server

**Enable SSL** - Check this box to enable SSL for WebSockets Secure. Note: If you enable SSL using this check box, then make sure Server SSL is not enabled on your Game Server's Network Transport/Manager settings. Only make sure that clients use WSS.

**Assign PlayFlow Port**: A random port on the PlayFlow Cloud is assigned to you that you can use. Most of the time, you will only need to do this once.

**Publish Server**: Builds a Linux Server version of your project and uploads it and starts it on the PlayFlow Cloud. Your server will be running for 60 minutes and will automatically stop after. You can publish multiple times to start new instances of your server.
‍
Publishing a server can take several minutes as it involves a few steps such as building the server version of your game, uploading it to PlayFlow, and then spinning up a temporary game server after. All uploaded server files are deleted after the game server is spun up.




**Unity Requirements**: Must have the **Linux Build Support Modules** for Unity.

This is not intended to be a production version game's server. 
The project will be updated occasionally so you may need to re-import the latest version of the Unity Package from time to time.
